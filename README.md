NormalGameofLife.py runs the regular Conway's Game of Life
- turn cells on by left clicking
- turn cells off by right clicking
- dragging these clicks also works to turn many cells on or off
- press spacebar to start the simluation
- the simulation can also be paused and played with spacebar
- cells can also be edited while the simulation is paused or running
- pressing the R key will randomize the grid so that 25% of cells are on
- randomizing can be done at any point in the simulation, even while its running

OutGameofLife.py allows the user to input custom rules to make their own Game of Life
- 6 3x3 grids are displayed: 3 on top and 3 on bottom, each with a small square underneath
- clicking on any of the shown squares will turn it on or off
- The top three grids are live grids
- Unlike Conway's Game of Life rules, the cells do not turn off or on based on the number of alive cells in their surrounding. Instead, if the surrou

- The top three grids are used to create custom live rules and the bottom three are used to create kill rules
